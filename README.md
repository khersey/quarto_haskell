# Quarto in Haskell

This project was created for CIS*4900 - Computer Science Research Project.

The goal of this course was to learn functional programming concepts, 
a function programming language, and apply these to implement a board game of your choice.

Please excuse me for putting all my code in one file,
It's not pretty but it works!

Tested on The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.1

**TO RUN:**
- In terminal run "ghci"
- in ghci run command ":load quartoLogic.hs"
- once loaded, enter "main" and the game will start

NOTE: if you make a mistake while playing the game and press backspace it will break everything
